Ordered by importance !

-Fix //TODO in code !!

-Fix World pos / local pos
Currrently, Only the LocalPosition of the Entity containing the COLLIDER (not the container) is used.

-Shape updating
Shape system, should be like Constraints system and allow direct modifications of field inside Bepu engine.

-Character controller (https://github.com/Nicogo1705/BepuPhysicIntegrationTest/issues/8)

-Add all constraints with examples in the scene
-Make a new Scene with a big demo of everything (like 10 000 cubes in a big mixer, that is supported by some ropes)

-Add Shape "instancing"


Bonus : 

-Add Newt generation system (using marching cube and/or voxel ?)
-Add Chain generation system (to make ropes, chains, bridges, ..)
