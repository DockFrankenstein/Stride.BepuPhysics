Ordered by importance !

-Fix //TODO in code !!

-Fix World pos / local pos
Currently, Only the LocalPosition of the Entity containing the COLLIDER (not the container) is used.

-Fixs "settings" (springSettings, MotorSettings, ... in Constraints by replacing the struc property by some properties for each field of the struct.)

-Shape updating
Shape system, should be like Constraints system and allow direct modifications of field inside Bepu engine.

-Character controller (https://github.com/Nicogo1705/BepuPhysicIntegrationTest/issues/8)

-Add all constraints with examples in the scene (like ConstraintTestDemo from Bepu)

-Make a new Scene with a big demo (like 10 000 cubes in a big mixer, that is supported by some ropes) - WIP nicogo

-Add Shape "instancing"

-Add wireframe from the Bullet Physics processor (debugging is a pain otherwise)

Bonus : 

-Add Newt generation system (using marching cube and/or voxel ?)
-Add Chain generation system (to make ropes, chains, bridges, ..)
