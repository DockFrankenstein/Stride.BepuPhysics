# BepuPhysicIntegrationTest - Work in Progress

Integrating [Bepu Physics v2](https://github.com/bepu/bepuphysics2) into [Stride](https://github.com/stride3d/stride).

## Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine and utilize it either as a library within your Stride project or as an independent Stride project.

1. **Add Bepu Settings**

    Note: Multiple Bepu simulations can be created by adding different settings. Later, when creating containers, you'll have the option to define which simulation to use.

2. **Add Containers & Colliders**

3. **Use Utility Scripts**

    These scripts allow runtime modification of the simulation using keyboard inputs and serve as a good starting point to understand Bepu integration in Stride.
