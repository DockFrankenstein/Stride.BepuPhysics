# Bepu Physics V2 Integration with Stride 3D - Work in Progress

## Informations 

[![Build nuget package](https://github.com/Nicogo1705/Stride.BepuPhysics/actions/workflows/dotnet-nuget.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Nicogo1705/Stride.BepuPhysics/actions/workflows/dotnet-nuget.yml)

Integrating [Bepu Physics v2](https://github.com/bepu/bepuphysics2) into [Stride](https://github.com/stride3d/stride).

Check out the Docs in the [wiki](https://github.com/Nicogo1705/Stride.BepuPhysics/wiki). (WIP)

## Features

1. Simulations: Highly configurable simulation & multi-simulation.
2. Bodies: Static, dynamic, and kinematic.
3. Colliders: MeshCollider, ConvexHullCollider, Box, Sphere, Cylinder, Capsule, Triangle (Note: MeshCollider is categorized as a container; further details are available in the documentation).
4. Constraints: All *(Refer to [Bepu Docs](https://github.com/bepu/bepuphysics2) for more details.)*.
5. Collision Handler by body, Trigger, RayCast & SweepCast.
6. CharacterBuilder/Controller & CarBuilder/Controller.
7. Navigation (Work in Progress).
8. Numerous utility scripts & scenes to aid understanding and usage of this Bepu implementation in Stride.
9.
